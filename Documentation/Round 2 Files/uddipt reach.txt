Hello Mr Uddipt! I am Anirudh, Mr Prashant's son. We spoke many months ago when you were helping me select a college. Thank you for that!

I recently participated in this contest by IIT Bombay called Techfest, where we had to create an application that when given a domain name, it would return the names, qualifications and other relevant details of the researches with knowledge in that specific domain.

I implemented a basic version, and my team has now been selected to implement a final version and present the application before a panel of judges.

Since you have the relevant experience in this domain of data collection and manipulation, could you please assist me in any way by providing me with a few tips on where I can take this project.

If you are free anytime could we meet up in a call to discuss how to continue this project.

Regards,
Anirudh
